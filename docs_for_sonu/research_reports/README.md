# Research Reports - OpenClaw Codebase Analysis

These reports were generated by 5 parallel exploration agents that deeply analyzed the OpenClaw codebase. Each agent focused on a specific domain and read actual source code (not just file listings).

## Reports

| # | Report | Focus Area | Tokens | Duration |
|---|--------|-----------|--------|----------|
| 01 | [Repo Structure & Config](01_REPO_STRUCTURE_AND_CONFIG.md) | Directory layout, package.json, all config files, workspace setup | ~47K | ~121s |
| 02 | [Backend Source Code](02_BACKEND_SOURCE_CODE.md) | Gateway server, 80+ API methods, auth, WebSocket, streaming, channels | ~83K | ~300s |
| 03 | [Frontend Source Code](03_FRONTEND_SOURCE_CODE.md) | Lit components, WebSocket client, chat UI, state management, device auth | ~65K | ~260s |
| 04 | [AI/Agent/Tools/Memory](04_AI_AGENT_TOOLS_MEMORY.md) | System prompt builder, LLM providers, 25+ tools, memory/vector DB, orchestration | ~130K | Longest |
| 05 | [Deployment & Infra](05_DEPLOYMENT_AND_INFRASTRUCTURE.md) | Docker, CI/CD, env vars, Render/Fly.io, testing configs, build scripts | ~58K | ~119s |
| | **Total** | | **~383K** | |

## How These Were Used

The findings from all 5 reports were synthesized into the main [COMPREHENSIVE_ANALYSIS.md](../COMPREHENSIVE_ANALYSIS.md) document, which provides:
- Architecture analysis
- Feature breakdown
- Strengths and weaknesses
- Proactive/agentic improvement proposals
- Deployment strategy
- Production readiness assessment
- Next action plan

## Reading Order

1. Start with `COMPREHENSIVE_ANALYSIS.md` for the high-level picture
2. Dive into individual reports for deep technical details
3. Report 04 (AI/Agent/Tools/Memory) is the most detailed and covers the core intelligence layer
